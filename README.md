# ML Project Template
Generic template to bootstrap your TF/Keras project. Click on and avoid writing boilerplate code for:

- **TF/Keras**
- **Hydra**, a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications.
- **DVC**, track large files, directories, or ML models. Think "Git for data".
- **Weights and Biases**, organize and analyze machine learning experiments. (educational account available)
- **Streamlit**, turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
